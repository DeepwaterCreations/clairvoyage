===========

This was my senior capstone project at Colorado College. It generates and renders procedural terrain. Right now, it's pretty limited - I was studying abroad for half my senior year and had really tough, time-consuming coursework for half the remaining time, so I didn't get to do as much with it as I wanted. Maybe - no promises! - I'll come back to it at some point and turn it into something more respectable. Burning Dice and RaG TeA both take precedence, and it's already been a year since RaG TeA saw any progress, so I'm not holding my breath on this one. 
But on the other hand, I've been wanting to get more into graphics programming after I've gotten to a good place with Burning Dice, so maybe I'll resurrect this when I do that. 

While I'm writing about it, I suppose the somewhat unusual naming choices in this program deserve comment. It's my opinion that a certain amount of poetic metaphor is desirable when it comes to names. Yes, even in computer programs. Ultimately, everything we do when we program is one great big mess of metaphors, after all. When we talk about "factory" classes, it's a metaphor. Calling something a "tree" or a "list" is ultimately a metaphor. Computers know nothing of "strings", they just have 1s and 0s. Picking metaphors from a more poetic viewpoint is a useful thinking tool. It lets us expand our repertoire of concepts beyond the immediately literal analogy.

I mean, all that's a very dry way of putting it. The point is just that it's a way to loosen up our brains, you know? Helps to think of things in different ways. 

Having said that, communication is also very important. Good class names should be clear. That doesn't mean they can't be poetic, just that the underlying metaphor should also be clear. I got a bit carried away with this one, because I was writing it with myself in mind as the audience. So if some of my more eccentric choices make no sense to you, rest assured that they make sense at least to me. If I were writing for a team, I'd tone it down - as I have indeed done with most of my other code.
But hey, playfulness is good. I know there isn't really a natural overlap between programmers and poets, but the two practices aren't as different as their practitioners might like to assume. This notion should be much more a part of programming culture than it seems to be, and the fact that it isn't is tragic. 
Somehow, the wizardly art of making these miraculous devices do strange and magical things has become married to the great leech that is the world of business. If you ask me, programmers should wander from city to city, wearing robes and great floppy hats and offering their art and wisdom where it is needed, until their wanderlust pulls them away again.
Except actually, that would require programmers to go outside and become exposed to sunlight, so maybe not.

Anyway, where was I? 

Oh yeah, this program. Okay. Well, whatever, I think it mostly just speaks for itself. You can run it and a terrain thingy will appear, and you can use the mouse to wobble it around. That bit could use some work, actually. Also, there's no real user interface for tweaking the variables. There's the beginnings of one, but I didn't really get very far for some reason. Like I said, maybe I'll come back to it someday.
